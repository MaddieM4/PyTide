Welcome to the wonderful fabulous Drag N' Drop experiment zone!

This is a special, minimalist branch for testing out and understanding
the mechanics of drag-n-drop operations in GTK, especially ones
involving embedded browsers.

If you're going to develop for PyTide, you're probably best off
waiting until after version 1 is released, since we're not
even going to start work officially on drag-drop at all until
then. 

That's right, the ability to drag a wave out of a list
and open in in a new window or an existing one isn't slated until
version 2 or 1.5 or whatever. As nice a feature as that would be,
PyTide has a long way to go and (at the time of this writing,
naturally) not all that much manpower. Enthusiasm is great, but
we have to budget our resources somewhere. If you still want to 
get a head start on it, then go right ahead, but there are more 
urgent things to build, where your help would be even more appreciated.
