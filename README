This will only work if you have the Python modules webkit and/or 
GtkMozEmbed installed. You also have to have GTK installed and 
available to Python.

If you have that stuff and PyTide still doesn't work, that's an
issue. PyTide is still in a state of constant change so it could
have been recently broken for everyone. Figure out what's wrong
if you can, wait a while and redownload if you can't.
