This will only work if you have the Python modules webkit and/or 
GtkMozEmbed installed. You also have to have GTK installed and 
available to Python.

If you have that stuff and PyTide still doesn't work, that's an
issue. PyTide is still in a state of constant change so it could
have been recently broken for everyone. Figure out what's wrong
if you can, wait a while and redownload if you can't.

Also note that this folder is basically a horrible mess, very
much like an apartment that hasn't needed to be cleaned since
I started renting, and now people are visiting. So yeah. There's
stuff that doesn't do anything. There's stuff that's earlier 
than experimental. There's basically no documentation. It's a
wreck. I already know this.

If I could ask for anything in particular as something that 
would help the cause - help expand the WaveImages.txt file
by adding the base64 URLs for any images in Wave you can find.
That would be a huge timesaver for me in the GUI department.

Also, once we hammer out a base WaveConnection class that can
be subclassed to make plugin-like protocols for each server
type, we can actually start making those plugins. I think
that's where the open-source concurrency of this project is
really going to have an opportunity to shine.
